This is a simple chrome extension that I had fun making. It uses a chrome manifest page written in JSON to run a JS script. I leveraged Chrome API functions such as EVENT PAGES, ALARMS, NOTIFICATIONS, and TABS, along with some Ruby scripting and random word generation. 

The APP produces a desktop notification that delivers a "motivation" line in the form of "(ACTION PHRASE)+(RAND ADJECTIVE)+(RAND NOUN)". It is able to determine if you are on a site like Facebook and will incorporate that in it's intermittent messages. 

Enjoy getting yelled at. 


For Installation:

1) Download this entire directory and go to chrome://extensions/
2) Click "Load Unpacked Extension", upload the directory and enable the extension.


Cheers!
